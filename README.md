Ironhack Hackathon

Your team has been hired by SuperFood, Inc., an agricultural biotechnology company focused on the production of superfoods. Thanks to the health craze of the last years, they are doing well enough among the target interested in a healthy lifestyle but this is not enough. SuperFood, Inc. wants to reach a wider audience with a campaign to popularize superfoods called "Beet, Don't Kale My Vibe". They want to position superfoods as something not just healthy, but fun, young and appealing. Your team will be in charge of a key element of this campaign: designing and building the landing page.

In digital marketing, a landing page is a standalone web page, created specifically for the purposes of a marketing or advertising campaign. It’s where a visitor “lands” when they have clicked on a Google AdWords ad or similar. In this particular case, the visitor will arrive to the landing page you'll create after having clicked on a Facebook ad, the first touchpoint of the campaign with its target.
